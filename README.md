# Proofvault
ProofVault is a decentralized system that captures real-world sensor events — like door access, motion, fire, or vibration — and logs them immutably on-chain. Designed for environments where trust, traceability, and proof of physical occurrence are critical, it acts as a cryptographic black box for the physical world.
